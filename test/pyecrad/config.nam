! Configuration namelists for ecRad radiation scheme
!
! The "radiation_driver" namelist controls the behaviour of the fortran
! driver routine, including parallelization options and overriding numbers
! read from the NetCDF input file. Because this namelist is used to
! run the reference fortran implementation (which uses this namelist)
! to evaluate the python implementation (which do not use it), every
! modification done here must be transferred to the python script.
!
! The "radiation" namelist controls the behaviour of the radiative
! transfer algorithm itself, it is used by both versions. Any line
! prefixed by "!" is ignored. If a namelist parameter is missing then
! ecRad will use a default value.  For most parameters you can see
! what ecRad has used from the output printed to the terminal when it
! runs.
!
! The "iverbose*" parameters specify the verbosity level: 0=none,
! 1=warning, 2=info, 3=progress, 4=detailed, 5=debug
