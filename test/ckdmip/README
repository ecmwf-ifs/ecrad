This file contains
"ckdmip_evaluation1_concentrations_present_reduced.nc", the 50
clear-sky atmospheric profiles of the CKDMIP "Evaluation-1" dataset
described by Hogan and Matricard (GMDD 2020), and the corresponding
line-by-line fluxes in
"ckdmip_evaluation1_lw_fluxes_present_reduced.nc" and
"ckdmip_evaluation1_sw_fluxes_present_reduced.nc".

Type "make" in this directory to run ecRad on these profiles.  You
will need the nco tools.

Then run the Matlab script "do_evaluate_ecrad.m" to evaluate the ecRad
calculations against line-by-line, producing plots in the same style
as Figs. 5 and 7 of Hogan and Matricardi (2020).

Edit the gas_model_name in the config.nam file to change the gas
optics model used by ecRad.
