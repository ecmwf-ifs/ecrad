*** BASIC TEST ***

This file contains
"ckdmip_evaluation1_concentrations_present_reduced.nc", the 50
clear-sky atmospheric profiles of the CKDMIP "Evaluation-1" dataset
described by Hogan and Matricard (GMDD 2020), and the corresponding
line-by-line fluxes in
"ckdmip_evaluation1_lw_fluxes_present_reduced.nc" and
"ckdmip_evaluation1_sw_fluxes_present_reduced.nc".

Type "make" in this directory to run ecRad on these profiles.  You
will need the nco tools, because the shortwave calculation is
performed five times for different solar zenith angles and the results
are concatenated into one file.

Then run the Matlab script "do_evaluate_ecrad.m" to evaluate the ecRad
calculations against line-by-line, producing plots in the same style
as Figs. 5 and 7 of Hogan and Matricardi (2020).

By default the ecCKD gas optics is used: to use RRTMG, use instead
"make GASMODEL=rrtmg", which uses the namelist file config-rrtmg.nam
instead of config-ecckd.nam.  To use a different spectral
configuration file with ecCKD, edit config-ecckd.nam.


*** CKDMIP SCENARIOS ***

To run ecRad on a wider range of CKDMIP scenarios, first download a
selection of concentration files from the CKDMIP FTP site to the
"concentrations" directory:

  make download

This also downloads the line-by-line reference fluxes to "lbl_fluxes".
Then run ecRad on them using ecCKD gas optics with:

  make scenarios

This generates *_lw_fluxes_* and *_sw_fluxes_* files in the "fluxes"
directory.

Or with the following you can use RRTMG gas optics:

  make GASMODEL=rrtmg scenarios

You can clean up with "make clean" or delete any downloaded files with
"make distclean".
