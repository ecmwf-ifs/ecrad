version 1.3.0 (20 March 2020)
	- Corrected shortwave band fluxes in Cloudless and Homogeneous
	  solvers, which scaled the direct downwelling spectral flux by the
	  cosine of the solar zenith angle twice
	- Write "experiment" global attribute to output if
	  radiation_config variable "experiment_name" is present
	- Previously overlap_decorr_length_scaling=0.0 was ignored; now it
	  implements random overlap
	- Added the ecRad practical exercises to the "practical" directory
	- Removed non-functioning hooks to PSRAD code

version 1.2.0 (30 October 2019)
	- Increased default minimum cloud effective size to 100 m
	  (although 500 m is used in the IFS for better SPARTACUS
	  stability)
	- Reduced max_cloud_od to 16 for SPARTACUS stability
	- Allow water vapour to be specified by "h2o_mmr" or "h2o_vmr" if
	  "q" not present in input file
	- Fixed effective_size_scaling namelist variable, broken in v1.1.8
	- cos_solar_zenith_angle not needed if do_sw=false
	- skin_temperature set to lowest air temperature if not provided
	- Warning issued if default solar_irradiance of 1366 is used
	- Added radiation_config namelist variable "vmr_suffix_str"
	  (default "_vmr") to enable the expected variable names containing
	  gas volume mixing ratios to be overridden
	- Use the nf-config utility to set NETCDF_INCLUDE and NETCDF_LIB

version 1.1.10 (8 April 2019)
	- Renamed occurrences of "encroachment" with "entrapment" to match
	  terminology of Hogan et al. entrapment paper, but namelist
	  interface still accepts sw_encroachment_name (sw_entrapment_name
	  preferred) and encroachment_scaling (overhang_factor preferred).
	- Added gas%scale routine to scale gas concentrations and namelist
	  parameters driver_config%co2_scaling (and all gases) so that users
	  can easily test the effect of, for example, doubling CO2 or
	  setting it to zero.
	- Fixed parameterization of cloud scales in radiation_cloud to
	  optionally take as input the range of columns to process.
	- Redefined use of scale_factor in radiation_gas.F90

version 1.1.9 (9 Feb 2019)
	- Mapping from albedo/emissivity intevals to bands may be done as
	  before by selecting the nearest interval to the centre of each
	  band, or now by computing the fractional overlap of each interval
	  with each band.  This is controlled by the
	  do_nearest_spectral_[sw_albedo|lw_emiss] configuration parameter
	- The user can specify the spectral range of the albedo/emissivity
	  intervals using namelist parameters
	  [sw_albedo|lw_emiss]_wavelength_bound and
	  i_[sw_albedo|lw_emiss]_index, or calling the
	  config%define_[sw_albedo|lw_albedo]_intervals routines before
	  calling setup_radiation, which does the actual mapping once the
  	  ecRad bands are known
	- Parameterize cloud separation scale via radiation_driver
	  namelist options "cloud_separation_scale_[toa|surface|power]"
	- radiation_driver:do_correct_unphysical_inputs namelist option
	  does not simply warn about unphysical inputs (e.g. negative gas
	  concentrations) but fixes them
	- Replaced LwDiffusivity by 2.0 in
	  radiation_two_stream:calc_frac_scattered_diffuse_sw, which is
	  more consistent with the Zdunkowski scheme, but has a very small
	  effect

version 1.1.8 (17 January 2019)
	- easy_netcdf.F90 allows for reading and writing slices of larger
	  arrays and writing HDF5 files, overcoming the maximum array size
	  limitation of classic NetCDF files
	- cloud%inv_inhom_effective_size allows different effective sizes
	  for cloud inhomogeneities and cloud boundaries in SPARTACUS,
	  important for realistic behaviour when cloud fraction is near one,
	  and can be specified directly in the NetCDF input file
	- The namelist variable "do_ignore_inhom_effective_size" in
	  "driver_config" means that "inv_inhom_effective_size" will be
	  ignored if it is present in the file, reverting to the old
	  behaviour
	- Alternative input variables "inv_cloud_effective_separation" and
	  "inv_inhom_effective_separation" allow cloud structure for
	  SPARTACUS to be specified in a way less dependent on cloud
	  fraction
	- If "inv_cloud_effective_separation" provided but not
	  "inv_inhom_effective_separation" then the effective size of
	  inhomogeneities is computed as that for the clouds themselves
	  multiplied by the "cloud_inhom_separation_factor" namelist
	  variable from "driver_config" (or 1 if not provided).
	- Check physical bounds of inputs to radiation interface
	- [aerosol|ice|liq]_optics_override_file_name now read from namelist
	- radiation_homogeneous_[sl]w.F90 now stores spectral flux
	  profiles, if required

version 1.1.7 (8 January 2019)
	- Added "Cloudless" solvers in shortwave and longwave
	- Writing radiative_properties*.nc files now thread-safe
	- Fixed segmentation fault in solver_tripleclouds_sw when
	  do_save_spectral_flux .and. .not. do_sw_direct
	- Initialize shortwave properties in radiation_ifs_rrtm in case
	  sun is below horizon, needed for some compiler options
	- Modified test/ifs/ecrad_meridian.nc to allow sun to go below
	  horizon, rather than including the online correction for Earth
	  curvature.
	- Modified driver/ecrad_driver_read_input.F90 so that if sw_albedo
	  and lw_emissivity override namelist parameters are provided, they
	  don't also need to be provided in the input files

version 1.1.6 (17 December 2018)
	- Generalized "alpha" overlap matrix calculation to allow for
	  possibility that the two cloudy regions in the Tripleclouds
	  assumption are not of equal size
	- Introduced radiation_regions.F90 to compute region fractions and
	  optical depth scalings at the same time
	- New gamma distribution behaviour in Tripleclouds and SPARTACUS:
	  if fractional standard deviation FSD > 1.5 then use non-equal
	  fractions for the two cloudy regions, which better predicts
	  fluxes. Also set a minimum optical depth scaling of 1/40, which
	  means that Tripleclouds and SPARTACUS will give slightly different
	  fluxes from before (< 0.1 W m-2) even for FSD < 1.5
	- SPARTACUS shortwave encroachment uses new fast_expm_exchange
	  routine given that matrix to be exponentiated has a regular structure
	- Execution halts if gases not provided with 0 (well-mixed) or 2
	  dimensions; before execution silently continued with these gases
	  not present

version 1.1.5 (15 September 2018)
	- Added "Zero" option for sw_encroachment_name, which turns off
	  not only encroachment due to horizontal transport within regions,
	  but also encroachment due to horizontal transport between regions

version 1.1.4 (13 September 2018)
	- Added "Fractal" option for sw_encroachment_name, which makes a
	  better assumption about the cloud size distribution than
	  "Computed" in the part that uses the horizontal radiation
	  migration distance to work out how much exchange has occurred
	  under regions

version 1.1.3 (4 September 2018)
	- Added (shortwave) encroachment_scaling to namelist, configuring
	  how one assumes cloud boundaries line up in adjacent layers: 0.0
	  (the boundaries line up to the greatest extent possible given the
	  overlap parameter) and 1.0 (the boundaries line up to the minimum
	  extent possible, which was the old behaviour)
	- Fixed related minor bug where encroachment transfer rate was
	  computed from the edge lengths in the wrong layer

version 1.1.2 (3 September 2018)
	- Added Python script test/ifs/plot_ifs.py (thanks to Alessio
	  Bozzo)
	- Bug fix in calculation of direct horizontal migration distance
	  in radiation_spartacus_sw.F90
	- Added namelist parameter min_cloud_effective_size to help with
	  stability of SPARTACUS

version 1.1.1 (29 August 2018)
	- Complete reformulation of the calculation of horizontal
	  migration distances in radiation_spartacus_sw.F90

	  SPARTACUS shortwave solver to units 101 and 102, which can be
	  tested with test/i3rc/plot_encroachment.m
	- Enabled radsurf canopies to include longwave gas
	  absorption/emission at full spectral resolution
	- Monochromatic shortwave properties now more consistent with 0.55
	  micron wavelength (g=0.86, ssa=0.999999, delta-Eddington applied)
	- Now pass in KLEV rather than a structure to ifsrrtm routines

version 1.0.15 (18 April 2018)
	- Added capability to provide aerosol optical properties rather
	  than mixing ratios, implemented via the add_aerosol_optics_direct
	  routine
	- Removed dummy "method" argument to calc_two_stream_gammas_?w
	- Removed a large number of unused dummy arguments
	- Updated README and test/ifs/ecrad_meridian_default_out_REFERENCE.nc

	- Large number of improvements and fixes to the treatment of urban
	  areas

version 1.0.13 (14 March 2018)
	- Extra securities on transmittance, reflectance etc. in shortwave
	  SPARTACUS solver
	- Reduced default max_cloud_od for SPARTACUS solver to 18 for
	  stability
	- Finally fixed permute option when writing 3D array using
	  easy_netcdf.F90

version 1.0.12 (22 February 2018)
	- Optimized radiation_ifs_rrtm.F90 and radiation_cloud_generator.F90

	- Corrected "computed encroachment" in SPARTACUS shortwave solver
	  to propagate migration distances according to overlap rules
	- Default configuration file in test/ifs directory is for Cycle
	  46R1 of IFS, which includes longwave scattering, fixes LW ice
	  optics bug and computes shortwave delta-Eddington scaling for
	  particulates only

	- Added single precision option: compile with "make
	  SINGLE_PRECISION=1"
	- easy_netcdf can read 4D arrays (thanks to Alessio Bozzo)
	- Renamed single-character variables
	- New data/yi_ice_scattering_rrtm.nc with longwave extinction
	  rather than absorption coefficient (thanks to Mark Fielding)
	- Added security on n_scat_diffuse

version 1.0.9 (26 July 2017)
	- Refined shortwave SPARTACUS such that computed encroachment
	  estimates the number of diffuse scattering events and reduces the
	  migration distance accordingly
	- Optimized calculation of longwave reflection/transmission coeffs

version 1.0.8 (22 July 2017)
	- Added lognormal/gamma cloud PDF options that affect McICA,
	  Tripleclouds and SPARTACUS solvers: namelist entry
	  "cloud_pdf_shape_name" can be "Lognormal" or "Gamma" (default
	  "Gamma")
	- radiation_driver can read "iseed" variable for seeding the McICA
	  cloud generator

	  Fielding): namelist entry ice_model_name="Yi"

version 1.0.7 (7 July 2017)
	- Bug fix in reformulated SPARTACUS solver

version 1.0.6 (4 July 2017)
	- Reformulated shortwave SPARTACUS solver to have the option of
	  explicitly computing "encroachment" (what Shonk & Hogan called
	  "anomalous transport") accounting for expected horizontal

	- Fixed Makefile options for PGI Fortran
	- Removed erroneous commas from test/i3rc/Makefile
	- Renamed variables shadowing intrinsics "scale" and "index"

version 1.0 (13 February 2017)
	- Read RADRRTM and RADSRTM from data directory
	- Renamed "PROFILE" in test/i3rc/Makefile to avoid clash with use
	  of the same name in top-level Makefile

version 0.9.48 (13 January 2017)
	- test/ifs now includes a test where aerosol is turned off, and a
	  reference output NetCDF file so that the compilation can be checked

	- save_inputs stores iseed in double precision
	- test/i3rc contains I3RC test case

	- Added OpenIFS license
	- Changed build system to use Makefile_include.<prof> files
	- Renamed package from "spartacus" to "ecrad"
	- Fixed writing of 3D arrays in easy_netcdf to permute
	  withorder=i_permute_3d(i_permute_3d)
	- Offline code can be run on input data written by
	  radiation_save:save_inputs
	- New file socrates_droplet_scattering_rrtm.nc with manually
 	  changed coefficients for shortwave band 11 to prevent singularity
	  in SSA calculation at re=25.733um.  Note that there is still a
	  singularity at re=1.63um in shortwave optical depth in band 10,
	  so effective radius should be capped to the range 2-50 microns.

version 0.9.44 (22 October 2016)
	- Revised aerosol scattering file aerosol_ifs_rrtm_43R1.nc
	- Fixed radiation_cloud_cover: it could access arrays out of
	  bounds - provided that the memory address was accessible this
	  would have had no impact since the data were not used

version 0.9.43 (23 September 2016)
	- RADRRTM and RADSRTM can now be read from directory in
	  environment variable "DATA"
	- do_fu_lw_ice_optics_bug is now a namelist option
	- Added Baran 2016 ice optics option

	  single scattering albedo is one minus what it should be
	- Ensure initialization to zero of [od/ssa/g]_[sw/lw]_[liq/ice]
	  variables in radiation_cloud_optics.F90
	- Removed Dr Hook calls for small routines called many times:
	  everything in radiation_two_stream, plus
	  radiation_aerosol_optics_data:calc_rh_index, calc_liq_optics_*,
	  calc_ice_optics_*

version 0.9.40 (14 July 2016)
	- Updated files in ifs directory

version 0.9.39 (22 June 2016)
	- Renamed cloud_cover_* routines to cum_cloud_cover_* since they
	  compute the cumulative cloud cover, and added a "cloud_cover"
	  function that does actually compute the total cloud cover (only)
	- Use gamma rather than lognormal distribution for McICA to better
	  match the current IFS
	- radiation_cloud::set_overlap_param now uses the correct layer
	  separation from temperature and pressure, rather than an
	  approximate one using a constant atmospheric scale height
	- radiation_cloud_generator now correlates cloud inhomogeneities
	  between non-adjacent layers if the Exp-Exp overlap scheme is used
	- radiation_cloud_cover::cum_cloud_cover_exp_exp now checks for
	  pair_cloud_cover not consistent with the cumulative cloud cover
	  profile

version 0.9.38 (2 June 2016)
	- Added Tegen climatology data file and modified
	  radiation_aerosol_optics_data to read data files that don't
	  contain hydrophilic aerosols
	- Added Slingo (1989) and Lindner and Li (2000) liquid droplet
	  optics parameterizations for backwards compatibility with the IFS,
	  although note that Slingo (1989) has been found to have errors

version 0.9.37 (17 May 2016)
	- Added do_3d_lw_multilayer_effects to mirror the same for
	  shortwave.  This controls whether off-diagonal elements are
	  permitted in the total_albedo matrix - these represent the
	  probability that downwelling radiaton exiting a region is
	  reflected up in another region.  This may be due to transport
	  through cloud sides, or due to "anomalous" horizontal transport
	  where fluxes are homogenized in regions.  Unlike in the shortwave,
	  this option is not forced on if 3D effects are enabled; in fact,
	  it is probably better to turn it off in both 1D and 3D cases
	  because this homogenization is not likely to occur to any
	  significant degree in the longwave.
	- Added capability to select single/double precision in
	  easy_netcdf.F90, and radiative properties are now stored in double
	  precision.
	- Changed verbosity settings of driver: 2 = print *all* setup
 	  info, 3 = also print numbers of current profiles being processed.
	- radiation_ifs_rrtm now checks solar zenith angle for positivity
	  to decide whether to set incident solar radiation to zero


version 0.9.36 (10 May 2016)
	- Bug fix in radiation_monochromatic.F90: Planck profile calculation
	- Maximum 3D transfer rate is now configurable (max_3d_transfer_rate)
	- Inverse effective cloud size can be specified separately for eta
	  in the bands 0-0.45, 0.45-0.8 and 0.8-1 via high_inv_eff_size,
	  middle_inv_eff_size, low_inv_eff_size in the radiation_config
	  namelist.
	- License and copyright now in LICENSE and NOTICE; COPYING has
	  been removed
	- "ifs" directory added illustrating how the radiation scheme is
	  called from the IFS, including the routines for computing cloud
	  particle effective radius.

version 0.9.35 (29 April 2016)
	- Added Exponential-Exponential overlap capability to match
	  original IFS Raisanen cloud generator
	- Overlap in McICA can be selected with overlap_scheme_name in
	  namelist = Exp-Exp, Exp-Ran or Max-Ran
	- Removed test on od_over_mu0 in
	  calc_reflectance_transmittance_sw, which speeds up IFS
	  implementation
	- In same routine, increased minimum "k^2" to 1.0e-12_jprb which
	  removes noise in clear-sky upwelling versus solar zenith angle

version 0.9.34 (20 April 2016)
	- Added option to do delta-Eddington scaling after merging with
	  gases, which seems less "correct", but is how the original IFS
	  scheme works
	- Delta-Eddington now a header file included by several modules
	- Clarified that RRTMG license is now BSD 3-clause

version 0.9.33 (March 2016)

	- Print out description of aerosol types being used
	- Added iverbosesetup in order to specify separately the verbosity
	  of the setup and normal execution parts
	- Removed "is_verbose" from namelist
	- Removed "ncol" as an argument from the solvers
	- PS-Rad RRTMG option now prefixed by PSRAD in the code and the
	  directory structure; radiation_ifsrrtm renamed to
	  radiation_ifs_rrtm

version 0.9.30 (16 January 2016)
	- Bug fix: if layer overcast and only 2 regions then 3D
	  calculations not performed

	  wrong column
	- Optimized SW reflectance transmittance: use simple expression

	- Added no-scattering solver for McICA longwave, typically used in
	  clear skies when aerosol scattering is turned off

version 0.9.25 (4 November 2015)
	- Reordered gas and cloud optical properties to have g-point
	  varying fastest, leading to a significant speed-up

version 0.9.24 (4 November 2015)
	- Added possibility for radiation to be transported directly
	  between regions a and c, via clear_to_thick_fraction
	- Added capability for direct beam from overhead sun to pass
	  through cloud sides, to improve 3D effect for overhead sun
	- Read McICA PDF look-up table from mcica_lognormal.nc to
	  radiation_pdf_sampler.F90
	- Verified McICA cloud generator
	- Added capability to interpret overlap parameter as Hogan &
	  Illingworth's "alpha" rather than Shonk et al.'s "beta", made this
	  the default and verified that McICA and SPARTACUS give the same
	  total cloud cover.
	- Added capability to repeat calculation multiple times for better
	  profiling
	- Gas optics unit scaling now done all at once to avoid bugs

	- Better diagnostic of aerosol settings in print_config
	- Included longwave internal radiation distribution
	  parameterization for 3D (config%do_lw_side_emissivity)
	- Added requirement for non-zero water content in
	  radiation_spartacus_?w.F90

version 0.9.21
	- Fixed the monochromatic option

version 0.9.20
	- Bug fixes in radiation_matrix.F90 and radiation_ifsrrtm.F90
	- Better printing of the configuration in radiation_config.F90

	- Module radiation_io for abort and output units
	- Started shortwave McICA implementation

	  in the radiation_driver namelist
	- Fixed bug where upwelling longwave surface clear-sky flux was

	  Note that to enable 3D effect to be calculated, this is done even
	  if 3D effects are turned OFF.

version 0.9.15
	- Added capability to output fluxes per g-point with
	  do_save_gpoint_flux
